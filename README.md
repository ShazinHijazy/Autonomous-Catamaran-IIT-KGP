# ðŸš¤ Autonomous Catamaran Project
Autonomous surface vehicle powered by Raspberry Pi, T100 thrusters, and onboard sensors with remote and autonomous control modes. 
# 
This repository contains the software and system integration code for an autonomous catamaran developed using a Raspberry Pi 3B, Blue Robotics T100 thrusters, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), and a modular sensor suite. The vessel is capable of manual keyboard-based remote operation and is being expanded to support full autonomy using IMU, GPS, and navigation logic.

The project is part of a research effort to explore low-cost, modular marine robotics platforms suitable for tasks such as environmental monitoring, bathymetry, and academic demonstrations.

**Key Features:**
1. Manual thruster control with real-time feedback
2. Safe states: emergency stop, pause, and reset
3. Independent power control per thruster
4. Support for future autonomous expansion (IMU, GPS, ROS integration)
5. WiFi-enabled headless operation via SSH
6. Modular and extensible Python codebase
