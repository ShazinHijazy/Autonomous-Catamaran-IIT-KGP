# Autonomous Catamaran Thruster Control System

This project demonstrates a Python-based thruster control system for an autonomous catamaran, developed using a Raspberry Pi 3B and T100 Thrusters from Blue Robotics. It enables both manual and future autonomous control using real-time keyboard input via SSH or a local interface.

The aim of this project is to establish a foundational control layer for a maritime surface vehicle, supporting future integration with sensors, navigation algorithms, and autonomy frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time control of dual thrusters via keyboard (WASD + arrow keys)
- Adjustable speed control for each thruster independently
- Safety features:
  - Emergency stop (X)
  - Pause and resume (Spacebar)
  - Reset all speeds (R)
- Terminal dashboard with thruster status
- Raspberry Pi-compatible (tested with headless setup)
- PWM signal generation through pigpio

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- 1 × Raspberry Pi 3B (with Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit)
- 2 × Blue Robotics T100 Thrusters
- 2 × Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
- 4 × 3.7V Li-Ion Batteries (connected in series for 14.8V total)
- 1 × Powerbank (for Raspberry Pi)
- Jumper wires, connectors, and waterproof enclosures
- Catamaran hull built by the Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture team

## 🧠 Software Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pigpio library (PWM control)
- keyboard library (for keyboard input)
- SSH setup for remote access (optional)
- Tested on both Windows and Raspberry Pi OS
